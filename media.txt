@media Bubbling

Sass does provide what I consider to be a pretty killer feature for authoring @media when you nest them inside other selectors. If you add a @media query by nesting it inside a selector Sass will "bubble" that @media query and the new rule outside of the nest and back out to the root of your style sheet.

I use @media un-nested (as mentioned above) when I'm setting up large-scale changes like a responsive master grid, but I find that I need to make small adjustments much more often. For example, lets say you have a profile picture that looks great large and floated to the left on a desktop, but needs to shrink on a smaller screen. It also needs to stop floating on a really wide screen.

In Sass we can write that like this.

.profile-pic {
  float: left;
  width: 250px;
  @media screen and (max-width: 320px) {
    width: 100px;
  }
  @media screen and (min-width: 1200px) {
    float: none;
  }
}

Sass will see this and know that you want to apply that query to the selector it's nested in. It compiles to CSS like so:

.profile-pic {
  float: left;
  width: 250px;
}
@media screen and (max-width: 320px) {
  .profile-pic {
    width: 100px;
  }
}
@media screen and (min-width: 1200px) {
  .profile-pic {
    float: none;
  }
}
